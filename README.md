# Simulation-of-Automatic-Door-Locking-System-Using-CANoe
Simulate an automatic door locking system in CANoe using DBC files for signal mapping. Develop CAPL scripts to lock doors at a speed threshold and unlock below it. Test varying speeds to validate functionality, ensuring reliability and adherence to protocols.
